Custom-Dialog
=============

Create Custom Dialog in Android

   Dialog box is mainly a popup or we can say a prompt that opens in front of the current activity to perform some
  operation or functionality. 


  You can use a dialog box to ask the user to confirm an action, notify the user of an event, or prompt the user 
  for additional information. Because dialog boxes disrupt the flow of the UI, you should use them only as a 
  last resort. In most cases, you should integrate confirmation, feedback, and prompts directly into your app.

   Sometimes in our applications we want to alert the user for an event and/or ask user about taking a decision. 
   For this purpose AlertDialog class can be used, where a message and one, two or three buttons are displayed in
   a popup window.

  When a dialog box opens the current activity by which we open the dialog box goes to the background and the 
  dialog box comes in the foreground. After performing the operation on the dialog box we dismiss the dialog box 
  and the background activity comes back to the foreground.
